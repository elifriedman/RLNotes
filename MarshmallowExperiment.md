# Marshmallow Experiment and its relationship to RL

* Delayed rewards are less valuable than immediate rewards
* It's easy to plan to delay receiving reward, but hard when encountering the actual frustration of delaying
  * Planned reward != Experienced reward / Abstract reward != Concrete reward [(Mischel, 2014)][Mischel2]
* Delay time is greatly affected by attention to reward [(Mischel, 1989)][Mischel] 11 minutes w/ no reward exposed.
6 minutes with reward exposed
* According to the RL gamma paradigm, if delayed reward is less valuable than current reward, then subject shouldn't delay at all.
Yet typically, subject does delay a bit and then fails. Why?
